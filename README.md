 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid & Flexbox)
- JavaScript

 How It Works
User clicks the calculator buttons to input numbers and operations.

JavaScript captures the input and updates the display in real-time.

Clicking "=" evaluates the expression using the built-in eval() function.

"C" clears the display, and "DEL" deletes the last entered character.
